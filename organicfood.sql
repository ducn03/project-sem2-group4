For Olive oil in general, there will be other types like Virgin/Pure/Pomance, only later pressings make the quality of the oil worse.\r\n\r\n- Cold pressing is a method of pressing oil that is not affected by oxidation by temperature.\r\n\r\n- Organic refers to the method of growing olives that are not contaminated by GMOs and chemicals.\r\n\r\n- Color: EVOO will have a darker color than other lines of Olive oil, EVOO Bragg has a very beautiful golden brown color.\r\n\r\n- Taste: Taste is also a qualitative factor in determining whether olive oil is genuine or not. For high quality oils you can smell the fresh olives.\r\n\r\n- The free acid index is an important indicator to evaluate the quality of olive oil. For the EVOO series according to the international standard of IOOC it is less than 0.8%, but for the EVOO Bragg it is 0.51% lower than the general standard. The reason olive oil is better, the lower this number is because the oil is actually an ester of a fatty acid. In the process of pressing under the effects of oxidizing oil, the bonds will be broken to create free acids. Thus, the free acid reflects the oxidizing effect of the cooking oil. The higher this number, the more oxidized the oil is and the stronger the odor becomes.\r\n\r\nBy determining this index will determine the quality of EVOO, it is also an important parameter for people to be able to determine how fake EVOO oil is. In fact, there are many fake EVOOs on the market today.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe peroxide ratio determines the initial oxidation of an oil. Peroxidation is oxidation. Exposure to heat, light, and metal surfaces accelerates oil oxidation.\r\n\r\nThe lower this value, the longer the oil will retain its shelf life and will delay the possibility of going rancid, while a high peroxide value usually indicates poor handling and low quality of the oil. Thus Olive Oil has a low peroxide value which means it is more stable and if stored properly, the shelf life is extended.\r\nEVOO Bragg has a peroxide value of 10.8 meqO2/kg, while the standard IOOC is <= 20 meqO2/kg', 3, 'img218.png', 100),
